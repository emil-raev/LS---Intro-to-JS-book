The use of pointers has a curious effect when you assign a variable that references an object to another variable. Instead of copying the object, JavaScript only copies the pointer. Thus, when we initialize f with e, we're making both e and f point to the same array: [1, 2]

JavaScript detects syntax errors based solely on the text of your program. Since they are detected before execution begins, you can't use a try/catch statement to catch one.

Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or a bug.
