 Other languages have similar key-value data structures, but they may use different names like dictionaries, associative arrays, maps, and hashes.

 delete removes the key-value pair from the object and returns true unless it cannot delete the property (for instance, if the property is non-configurable).

 Note that Object.keys returns the object's own keys: it does not include any keys from the prototype objects.
