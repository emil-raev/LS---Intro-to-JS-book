A runtime environment is an execution environment that lets an application program access system resources and provides the tools the application needs to operate. The compiler/interpreter and the operating system's APIs together make up a runtime environment. 

An Application Programming Interface (API) describes the scheme and format that a programmer can use to securely access resources, with the operating system acting as an intermediary.
